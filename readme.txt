This page describes the structure of our GitHub repository, which contains the outcomes and code from our project. The paper we replicated is Fowler, J. H., & Jeon, S. (2008). The authority of Supreme Court precedent. Social Networks, 30(1), 16â€“30.


BRANCH LIST

# main: The replication data provided by the authors has been uploaded.

# authority-score-calculation: We have uploaded our main code for calculating Figures 6 and 10, along with Figures 6 and 10 generated using the authority scores we calculated directly.

### Structure of the Main Code

	1) Matrix calculations for 5 cases
	2) Calculations using the HITS algorithm for 5 cases
	3) Speed comparison between matrix calculations and the HITS algorithm
	4) Authority score calculations for all cases across divided years
	5) Visualization of Figures 6 and 10
	6) Testing authority score calculation code using *testthat*

# miscellaneous: Figure 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10 replication code. Preliminary analyses were conducted for replication purposes, and the individual RMD files from team members have been uploaded separately.
